            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Nigeria, Delta state.
            Graduated from the university of Petroleum Resources, Effurun with a Bs.C in Geology.
            </p>
            <p>My passion for art is something i've kind of always had growing up. I love bringing the weird,
            sometimes whimsical, and creative stuff that goes on in my head out to the "real" world for others to see.
            My current style draws inspiration from an artist i found a while ago, Varguy, on Deviantart. An art based social platform.
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/varguy/gallery/all" target="_blank">Here's a link to his amazing gallery if you'd like to check him out</a>
            <p>I like videogames, anime, and i also <em>love</em> cooking. Back home, i had the very important job of being the family chef &#128513;
            I thank my mother everyday for introducing me to the wonderful world of cooking. P.S my signature dish is <b>Jollof rice</b>
            (it's literally the best thing in the whole world!)
            </p>

            <!--Preferably a quick self illustration or some funny stuff, i guess-->
